Notes:

a. Sequencial execution of code my the combution
b. now we can create branches, modify the flow of execution of the program or the set of instruction
c. We do that through the use of if else sattements
d. if eveluates an expression to be either true or false, if the condition

Show this
take 2 numbers a = 10, b = 12
if (a>b)
	{System.uot.println("a wins");}
else{System.uot.println("b wins");}

This is not complete, what if they are equal?
if (a>b)
	{System.uot.println("a wins");}
else if(b<a){System.uot.println("b wins");} //once one of the conditions is satisfied then the program pop out of the checking
else {System.uot.println("a and b are the same");}



Do this,
a. Roll 2 16 sided dice , Dice a and b
b. Inform the user as to which Dice had the larger roll or if the rolls were the same


Relational operators == >= <= !=



 Show this,
 Take 3 numbers a = 10, b = 25, c = 33
 Goal want to print which is the greatest
 
 if(a>b && a>c)
 {
 }
 else if(b>a && b>c)
 {
 }
 else if(c>a && c>b)
 {
 }
 else
 {
 }
 
 Logical operators && || !
 
 
Do this,
a. Roll 3 16 sided dice , Dice a and b and c
b. Inform the user as to which Dice had the larger roll or if the rolls were the same
